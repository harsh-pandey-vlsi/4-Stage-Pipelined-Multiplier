# 4-Stage-Pipelined-Multiplier
A 4-stage pipelined multiplier divides multiplication into four sequential stages—each generating and adding partial products. Data flows through pipeline registers at every clock cycle, enabling faster throughput by overlapping operations and producing one result per cycle after initial latency.
